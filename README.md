* fix loading bar height animation
* add symbol to new UI
* have ship class use a queue to store actions. peek this queue to get current task, removing need for booleans like finishedWarping, finishedRotating, warpAfterRotate.
* add gameplay events for the context menu to call
  * Dock
* experiment with making sky boxes using shader graph nodes. copy and flip the clouds

each system has global objects - these are objects that can be selected from anywhere in the system. warping to these locations might reveal local objects - these are objects that only show up while you're nearby, things like rocks, wrecks, gasses and ships.

1 unit = 1km
1 au = 150M km
