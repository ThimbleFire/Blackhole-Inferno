# Blackhole-Inferno
strategy spaceship game

Todo
rename Entity class HUDSticker
make planet HUDSticker an opaque circle
make player ship HUDSticker a transparent triangle
make left-clicking on HUDSticker select them
create Station, Planet, Ship and JumpGate classes and have them inherit HUDSticker
add public floating point called signature to HUDSticker
add warp to selected station, planet, jump-gate
add dock on selected station
add a 2D shopping mall experience


each system has global objects - these are objects that can be selected from anywhere in the system. warping to these locations might reveal local objects - these are objects that only show up while you're nearby, things like rocks, wrecks, gasses and ships.

1 unit = 1km
1 au = 150M km

create a test system modelled after the universe

add galaxy map
add dock features

add sims and ship customisation (much later)
