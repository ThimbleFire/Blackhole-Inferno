### How does the game start? (how does it get into its gameplay loop)

The screen fades in from black. The player character is standing up in their ship. Red lights are flashing, the navigation panel is on fire. The player character picks up a fire extinguisher and douses the flame. The light stops flashing, the character lets out a deep sigh and says "Guess I'm flying manual". The tutorial is now in effect. It can be skipped, however the ship will remain damaged until repaired. The player has the character sit and can control the ship. Sitting causes an enemy to spawn and a radio broadcast to start from said enemy, explaining why the ship is in such disarray. After the ship is destroyed they can tractor some loot. The ship as it currently is can't salvage ship remains.
The player character will announce they should return to the nearest station, what alignment they should face, and how far they need to travel. A popup will alert the player to their Star Map for further guidance.
Landing the ship, our protagonist will be outraged by the cost of repairs, announcing how the mission the player just completed is only just enough to pay for the services. As such, they're forced to get another mission.
