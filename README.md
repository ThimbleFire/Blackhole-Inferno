# Blackhole-Inferno

**Things I want in this game**
* [x] 1.0 Ship controls like Eve Online in which you can align, warp, orbit, lock targets, dock and jump
* [ ] 1.0 Purchasing modules and ships, and accepting missions in stations
* [ ] 1.0 Having a retro pokemon gen-1 style view of the inside of the ship which you can customize with facilities and ship modules
* [ ] 1.0 Ship crews are named and can have their job responsibilities modified. Modules will only operate in space while being operated in the ship
* [ ] 1.0 The world is not precedurally generated. It has a fully scripted and fully optional main story
* [ ] 1.1: Crew can build relationships with NPCs on stations, eventually they can marry and join the ship manifest - though they will not operate as crew members
* [ ] 1.2: Some kind of multiplayer

**Priorites**
* create the galaxy
* system jumping
* docking
  * trading
  * accepting missions
* ship management
* add symbol to new UI
